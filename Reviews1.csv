"Virginia Villarreal ""wizard""",B001NO6EA2,Excellent!!!,"This tuna is the best I have had. Crown Prince is excellent and contains much less mercury than other Albacore and much less than regular tuna. Got here promptly and was fresh. Will be ordering more cases! This has been the cornerstone of my diet, on which I have already lost 30LBS!!!"
Kenneth Dillibe,B0002YGSCI,I have found it,"I went through so many weak ""hot"" mustards before arriving at this, this is the very popular Chinese hot mustard you have been looking for that takes your breath away, unfortunately you may have to eat it alone, most of my friends don't think it is funny."
Grace,B001L4U298,DELICIOUS!,"Definitely not your normal popcorn. It's got seaweed flakes, sesame seeds and those rice crackers in it. Soo delicious when it's all mixed together and stuck to melted butter on the popcorn. YUM! I can't even go back to plain buttered popcorn anymore. But I'm a fan of rice cracker and seaweed, so maybe the combination of all of it on popcorn just spices it up for me."
M. Karazim,B000HG84E6,The Best,"Fruit leather is such a great snack!  I used to love fruit roll-ups until I tried fruit leather, and I won't ever buy them again.  I feel much better knowing that I am eating something with no added sugar.  Plus, 2 fruit leathers are equal to one serving of fruit.  These sell for 65 cents at my local grocery store, but with subscribe and save I can get them for just under 42 cents apiece.  My husband and I both eat them a lot, so it's worth it to me to pay for the big box."
L. Landry,B000FGXT2A,THIS IS AN INSANE PRICE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  YOU CAN FIND IT MUCH MUCH MUCH CHEAPER,"the 2 stars is because of pricing- not the productwhen amazon sells and fulfills an item, it's usually the lowest price anywhereif an outside vendor sells an item- you have to check the price and here is a perfect examplethe pricing here is CRAZY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!look elsewhere and you will be shocked at how much you have overpaid here"
Jerricat,B000RI1W8E,Great product at a great price,"A great product at a great price.  These little slim jim snacks taste much better than the full version sold in convenience stores.  Not sure why, but they do.  Others have written the same thing.  Very convenient box and easy to store.  Makes a great adder for school lunches and etc, or just a quick snack on the run."
"mizjean ""jean""",B0038A5QCQ,Love it!,"This is great! I have bought it for years, and it is always good. Nothing better with a morning cup of coffee."
"J. Ahued ""Jerky eater""",B000CQE3IC,Ay Ay Ay!!!,"Probably the best use for Tabasco Sauce to date!Great Flavor and intensity, easy to get addicted to."
GrandmaV,B000FFIL92,Great presentation and great selection for tea enthusiasts,My daughter-in-law loved this gift! She said the box was beautiful and the tea selection was just what she was wishing for. Anyone who loves tea would love this as a gift.
Sandra K. Morrison,B004IJJQK4,The best cookies ever!,"These are simply the best cookies ever.  My kids love them, I love them.  They're so much healthier than other cookie brands.  I couldn't recommend them more!"
Cassondra L. Cole,B000ED7M3Q,Bob's Red Mill All Purpose Mix,"I have a gluten intolerance and have recently started a gluten free diet.  I decided to try this all purpose mix to see if I could sub 1:1 for regular all purpose flour.  My cookies came out great, but the aftertaste of the bean flour in Bob's mix is awful.  I'm going to try mixing up my own blend of flours.  I don't think I'll buy this again (and I'll stay away from all bean flours from now on!!)"
"D. Tatner ""Rat Sass""",B000FVWFNO,Great for breaking the ice at parties.,"It's a wonderful gift, true... but I prefer to buy it for myself. Then I carry it on an airplane and make all the other passengers mad with envy.... while they're gnawing on roasted peanuts... I'm wallowing in aromatic cheese products. :)"
M. Keidel,B00020HHRW,Dr Oz recommended!,"Dr. Oz recommended fenugreek tea for your digestive track,(not this brand specifically). It was a good introduction.Personally, don't care for the taste by itself, but with a bit of honey,yum! Will purchase again."
T. Beck,B007TJGY46,Best of the Dark Roasts,Jet Fuel is our favorite of all the Coffee People dark roasts.  Bold but not bitter.  Great way to start the morning!
"Eric Morrison ""battleforhealth[dot]com""",B0000D9N38,WOw my favorite cheese ever,"This is amazing cheese!  Straight from Spain... it's pricey, but worth it.  One of my top favorites."
"K. Bennett ""Low End Thumper""",B005NDXR3Q,Nice gift,"I just wanted a little extra gift to hand dad for Father's Day and this fit the bill. The logs are a little smaller than I would have liked but it was good sausage and cheese, overall I'd say it was worth the price paid."
Tracey,B001D0DMME,YUMMY! YUMMY! YUMMY!,"This is the only health bar, that is the KIND BAR that can compete with such treats as M&M Peanuts, MARS Bars, Baby Ruth etc.,this one dark chocolate with peanuts is my very favorite..I put them in the freezer and they then make a great summer treat!!!"
marlene Burnette,B00153HNQK,Love em,I love these fruit snacks and found it cheaper to buy them in bulk to pay a dollar for such a little one.
rawraws,B003LPSKPS,Best Mayo,I'm fortunate enough to live in the south where this is widely available.  But if you can't get it where you live it's worth ordering.  For a long time I thought there wasn't much difference in mayonnaise brands.  But when you try Duke's you'll see.  I even will occasionally lick a swipe off my finger with nothing else it tastes so good.
Neal Mayborn,B003QNLUTI,not that different from regular 5 hour,this has more caffiene and 2000 mg of energy blend... instead of 1870 mg energy blend... I can't tell the difference from regular 5 hour energy but it costs more. it's good though. I think 5 hour energy is the best energy shot available.
"J. Raisdanai ""oosagii""",B0085ZYAZ8,"Any occasion gift, including Father's Day!!!!",Just received 2 that I ordered for my father and father-in-law. Packaged a lot nicer than the pic displays. I will have to place some more chocolates and goodies though. Since both of them have a severe sweet tooth. Highly recommend!!!!!
Christoph E. Mottes,B0029XDZKI,one of the better ones,This one and I think same company butter toffee are the two I've liked the most among K-cups.  Coworkers agree.  Liked better than Donut Shop.
L. Densford,B000VKA6I0,Only product my dog doesn't destoy immediately,"My dog loves this toy.  He destroys other toys within seconds to minutes at most.  This toy is the exception.  I have ordered several and set them aside for treats.  Yes, he does eventually bite the fuzz off the tennis balls and then proceed to bite through them, but this takes days or even weeks!"
"Ernest J. Smith ""lothianscot""",B000EVT04M,strange fruit,"Has a strong cherry flavor, presumably synthetic, but has a large, floppy, awkward shape.Needs to be eaten with a knife and fork! Would not buy again."
etcbmason,B000CONM86,Yummmm,"Awesome product...It is hard to find things with low sugar, low salt, and low fat with a great taste. This product definately fits the bill!"
Zed,B0007UQ73W,Best you can get for under a hundred dollars,Silky sweet and savory.  The best balsamic I have found for under $100. This is THE stuff. So much better than even the pricey stuff you may find in your average store. Highly recommended.
Pinky,B006N3IG4K,Best darn coffee :),I love this coffee - it's one of my all time favorites - it has the best flavor and I like the light roast.EXCELLENT!!!!
"James T. Hederman ""Jammer""",B000KNB0OW,More for your money,I've tried most organic steel cut oats and this is a really good value per ounce of product. Very easy to prepare and consistent quality.
Shannon,B001TLY7A8,Great Cat Food,My cats are in love with the chicken. It looks and smells like cooked shredded chicken. This stuff is very good quality. I like how it is made with human grade freerange chicken and made in a human food facility. I will be buying again!
Mistor Bill,B007BTN97Y,Best ever,"These brownies are absolutely the best brownies I have ever tasted.  I have had them on several occasions and would recommend them to anyone and everyone.  In my own wacky statement "" They are better than S*X"".  You will not be disappointed with these brownies."
Bob,B00271NNLI,not pleased,"The pots broke my senseo coffee maker. They do not fit, too thick. I have used both trays, but non worked. Take this product of the marked."
"M. Davey ""pretzel queen""",B002L7HZ8U,Mr. Salty pretzels!,I remember eating these as a child. This is truly the best thin pretzel in the world!
Matt,B000GAT6NG,Good Stuff!,"This is a great coconut oil.  I've used it in cooking, shakes, as a substitute for butter.  It's fabulous."
Kesley,B003AYEHN4,Great Mate,I have tried a few brands of loose leaf Mate. So far this is my favorite- good flavor and not smoky like some brands.
M. Jacobs,B005VOONI0,Tasty,"I'm still not a food reviewer. The problem is that I can't turn down free coffee. That said, this is good stuff, mellow with none of the bitter edge common with a lot of the cheaper stuff sold at the local grocery store. I subtracted one star from the review because of the ridiculously pretentious ad copy on the box. Drinking this coffee won't fix the world or make your life more fulfilling, I'm fairly sure."
intexas,B007N4D3UK,8 ounces is not a pint,"The description for this item reads: 8oz (Pint) Plastic Jug (Bpa Free). An American pint is 16 ounces, not 8."
"M. Azzaro ""ma""",B000H23Z1C,"Not Bad, Not Great Either.","I tried a box and the best that I can say is, ""It's a little on the bland side"". We had to doctor it up to help it along. That's really about all that I can say about this brand."
"J. Lorenz ""JJ""",B000F2RIQC,Great tasting seasoning for chicken....,"however, if your close to a Sam's club or know someone close you can buy this for$6.12 per bottle instead of the inflated price here."
"Chauntria R. Lipscomb ""Fiction Goddess""",B0021L9XK4,Love it!,"I tried this for the first time yesterday and was impresssed...granted I took two within fifteen minutes of each other and the bottle doesn't advise that , but I almsot instantly (or really in about 5 minutes) felt a surge of energy. It only lasted an hour and a half though...."
Fitzgerald Fan,B005VOOM4A,Marley coffee,"This coffee is good, and because it is organic, it is worth the price. It's got a nice, round flavor but could stand to be a little more robust. The pods of course are ultra convenient, but I would quibble with the fact that the individual pouches do NOT have a notch in them for easy opening. I have to cut each pouch with a pair of scissors."
linda in texas,B001EO7E3W,tortilla soup mix,"i was disappointed in this one, it seemed very bland even though i used fresh broth to make it in and doctored it up a little.  not one that i'll buy again."
Uriah Jackson,B007M83302,Nothing Better,BBQ is my favorite flavor for all Popchips.Popchips are Healthy (as fas a a chip goes) and flavorful. The best chips I have ever eaten
"L. Keys ""oh i love those books""",B0001ES9FI,Me and my Senseo,"I love my Senseo! It so easy and clean, albeit expensive to use, but what the hey?  It's coffee and it's quick and it's tasty."
Renegade,B004SRH2B6,It's pretty good... for concentrate.,"Ingredients say coconut water from concentrate and natural flavor, not sure why the flavor is needed, but tastes almost nutty or toasted, probably from the heat process used to concentrate the juice. I like enough to drink it, but may decide to change brands. I ordered it because it was about half as much as it was at Whole Foods Market."
tela,B0034EFIYC,"Almond and Apricot? No, almond and coconut.","Just FYI, for those that don't prefer coconut like me, these Almond and Apricot bars are LOADED with coconut. It is the 2nd ingredient. You can taste the apricot, as a subtle aftertaste, but other than that, it might as well not be in the bar. The coconut pieces linger in your mouth, so carry a toothbrush close-by."
Brimley,B0096EZHM2,Cat loves it,My cat goes crazy for this food.  He eats it all and seems to be happy and healthy so I am going to keep ordering it and have done so with scheduled purchases.
sandra sisk,B000HDJZEM,Great value for the novice,"My husband has always wanted to try caviar and has asked repeatedly for me to order some as we don't get out much, plus we live in a small town and have never seen it available at restaurants here.  I ordered this one due to the affordability and good reviews and was not disappointed.  He has asked me to order two more boxes of 4, so he must have liked it."
"Hamza ""Y""",B000GAT6OU,Great snack,"I love these bars though they took a little bit of getting used to.  I was so used to Powerbars and other non-natural protein bars that are chewy and contain many ingredients that are not favorable for you body.  This one tastes RAW and it is a very good alternative, even replacement, to other bars.  I will order again.  Enjoy!"
San,B000FGXT2A,Great cereal by Kashi!,"I recently ordered the 6-box pack from Amazon, and I'm glad I did.  No worries about this cereal sitting in the closet as I've gone through 2 boxes already!  The cereal is light and tasty, with just the right amount of cinnamon and sweetness for me.  Mind you, I like just a hint of sweetness in my cereal - so don't expect anything sugary sweet.  Intend to order more once Amazon has stock."
"bass player ""bass player""",B001EQ5DG0,Very impressed with Sugar-Free Kool Aid,I'm drinking some Cherry Sugar-Freee Kool-Aid even as I write this.  I'm a diabetic and drink a gallon of water a day.  I like grape as well as cherry but this stuff is awesome...seems too good to be true.  Yum!
