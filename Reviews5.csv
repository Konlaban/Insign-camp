Janet Tsuei,B0068K2RAC,Anything with Chai is good!,"The apricot almond chai is such a unique flavor.The texture is sticky, seedy, and sweet! Definitely different from the bars out there. I highly recommend!"
Theodore H. Evans,B008FRM8DC,The tang that pleases,"Usually, when I return from England, I remember to purchase several Trebor extra strong mints.  I forgot this year and was delighted to discover that I could order some through Amazon.  I did so and have very much enjoyed them.Many thanks."
"E. Ellis ""edzin""",B0009X0RA6,Amazing price increase............,The food seemed to work well for my dogs.  I ordered a couple of bags and it seemed to last well. Returning to view my previous order I see the price has increased from $39.99 with free shipping to the new outrageous price.  Amazon can't maintain pricing and will soon be paying state taxes.  Sad you can't find a reliable supplier.
"Barbara J. Mcfarland ""artiste""",B0017U7TFG,"Ok, if you use the directions from one of the others.","Though not my favorite this is ok, great for those on diets where you need to limit Sodium, fat and etc. My recommendation though is you follow the instructions that were on a different flavor. After following the initial instructions instead of letting it sit after stirring, microwave at 20% power for an addt'l 5 mins. The flavors meld better and the pasta is a much better texture."
M. Yonan,B000FBQ594,Addicting! A big hit at parties,"Excellent cookie! Crisp, delicious and hard to stop eating. With a price like these at Amazon, they make a great reason to get a box for a party, gathering, treats for kids, etc."
"Edgar J. Kuntz ""CFCchuck""",B002HQLY7S,Best flavored Coffee,I have purchased many different varieties of flavored coffeee and this is far superior to all of the others.  It has great flavor but is a nice medium roast coffee that is perfect in the early morning or in the evening relaxing
1868,B0011CZ6BE,Mama Kate,"Everyone in our family loved these cupcakes!  Our 3 year old, the nanny, and my husband - WOW, they were moist, and full of yummy coconut.  I am back online to see what other flavors are available.  Definitely worth the money and not much effort - WAY better than William Sonoma's cupcakes...and this mix includes the sugar for the frosting!"
kristian,B0052M5V0A,gold capsules.,gold capsules. If the capsules are more expensive of the entire market surpassing by 100 percent from the same site the nespresso unfortunately I realized too late so I suggest to be careful when purchasing this product.It is a complete mockery shows how are you people take advantage of the unwary who bought the first time.
Cherie,B007TJGZ4A,would not buy again,This coffee has a bitter aftertaste to it and was very diluted on the 8 oz setting.  Not sure why this got so many good review but tastes like cheap coffee.
SJ in PA,B000GAPPAY,YUUUMMMMYY,"I received a pouch of this as a gift and made it for my family one day -- it is so delicious and everyone loved it.  And then, of course, they wanted me to make it again.  But I'd thrown out the packet and the info so am soooo very glad that I found it so easily on Amazon.  Just add crab and you have a gourmet soup!"
"Jennifer ""Jennifer""",B000LKTPCS,Absolutely delicious,"These are absolutely outstanding pretzels.  They melt in your mouth, slightly salty, creamy, cruncy.  Everything you want in a (healthy)  peanut butter filled pretzel.  My 16 year old son loves them.  My 17 year old loves them and I love them!  Not to mention my husband!!"
"Jill Gloger ""Glogirl""",B004779XNW,Disappointed that they changed the product,"I have been buying Green Mountain Dark Magic for a long time....not only did my recent shipment have different packing inside, but the coffee too has changed, and not for the better....it is much weaker, and I am sorely dissapointed....I even emailed Green Mountain regarding this change, and they did not even have the courtesy to respond! I will not be buying Green Mountain anymore."
be a healthy puppy,B000W5P0KI,"Very good food, but it was not for my puppy","I tried wellness and evo, but my puppy had loose stool.  so I studied and gave orijin puppy food, my puppy's stool got worse and she refuse to eat Orijin puppy food.  Now I have changed to other brand(dehydrated food-addiction), she likes it and seems working well so far.  Maybe Orijin was too much protein to her. I liked orijin product, so I was bit disappointed.  Maybe when she gets bigger, I may try adult Orijin."
ccossette,B002E0KW0M,Kids Heart GoGo Squeeze!,"My kids (ages 8 thru 20 months LOVE these as a quick snack!  So much better than fruit snacks or applesauce you eat with a spoon...no mess, easy to pack, and definitely a healthier choice."
"Susan Swan ""reads-curled-in-covers""",B000FBO9MO,"Oh, so very very very VERY good","I LOVE these cookies.  Most cookies are too sweet for me -- not these.  However, since they follow the  European trend of using  natural ingredients, they are full of saturated fat from butter and cream.WHO CARES?They are the best cookies, for me, in the world, comparable only to""Feullitees Doree,"" which can be bought on in France."
MyHumbleOpinion,B000E63LOW,My favorite....,"I am highly sensitive to caffeine and avoid it as much as possible...  This tea fits the bill and is a favorite of mine....  It's a plus above regular green decaf teas because it also contains a portion of white decaf tea...  White tea has additional anti-oxident properties, and this selection contains both....  Great price and subscription has it delivered right to your door with even a better deal.....  Well done, Amazon!"
Alex,B003ZXE80M,Yummy snacks!,"These are a perfect snack to grab on the way out when you don't have time to eat a meal. One bag is quite filling. I purchased on a subscribe and save and the price was awesome, but shortly after, I received an email that Amazon is discontinuing them so I guess I won't get anymore of them. Shame, they are a great price here- from now on I'll have to check the local warehouse clubs."
"C. Ruginski ""Lab Crazy""",B001EO6FSC,Grainy sugar.,Not so great. Sugar is grainy as if old or poorly processed. The maple flavor is great though. Although intended for table use we will probably use the sugar in Christmas baked goodies so it's not a total loss.
_Lucinda_,B0026ST9QK,Smaller than I had envisioned,"For the price, I was expecting a larger amount for some reason.  (This will be a gift, so I can't report on taste, but I thought I would mention the quantity aspect in case another customer is like me.)  The online description says 2 lbs, but the label says 28.35 oz.  Close, but not the same.Anyway, the container is less than 6"" tall, not too much bigger than one of those chunker flashlight batteries.  Now you know."
Kate,B006DHJW2Q,"Adorable, great gift!","I gave this as a gift and it was a big hit.  Nothing was broken, it was gift wrapped (paid for this), and even came with additional salt samples.  I was surprised at the amount of salt in each tube.  More than enough to get numerous meals of use out of each.  It was well recieved and I wouldn't hesitate to buy again.  I will say I think the shipping cost was a tad high, but the salt was a good deal so it evens out."
"Troglodyte ""Troglodyte""",B005Y1A8FW,Makes perfect serving-sized portions,"This is the second Beaba freezer tray that we've purchased, and still use both.  We bought the second tray so that we can make and freeze more baby food at a time.  The tray makes perfect-sized serving portions, and clean-up is very easy.  We run hot water over the back of each cup for one or two seconds, and the frozen food pops right out.  We store the individual servings in ziplock sandwich bags, makes it really easy to grab his food for the day and go."
Lisa Gray,B001PQNV6S,Great GF Staple,"I have a 4 yr old and a 2 yr old that can't eat gluten and this is an awesome products for them. We always have some with us where ever we go and they absolute love them. They are moderately sweet and crunchy.They also make a wonderful pie crust. 1 1/2 cup cookie crumbs, 5 TBS margerine, 1 TBS surgar. Mix and pat into pie plate. Bake 10 min at 350 degrees.We couldn't live without them. Thanks Mi-Del!!!"
K. Kelly,B000E158ES,Delicious,Our whole family loves these crackers.  I am not under some sort of illusion that they are super healthy or anything but I do feel better about the fact that they are organic and don't contain a bunch of ingredients that I've never heard of.  These are easy to pack in the diaper bag.  I always try to keep some on hand because you never know when they will come in handy.
designer,B001E53TMQ,Zowie!,These people are REALLY FAST.  I just placed the order last night and it is in the mail this morning.  The good service is really appreciated
"Jennifer Kerr ""me""",B000WFUL3E,Best Cat food EVER!!!,"This stuff is great. The cats love it ( all flavors actually), and since eating it their coats are softer, shinier, with less dandruff."
J. Burns,B000EDG4V2,Better Option for us than Xanthan Gum,"I use this product as a ""binder"" in gluten-free baking as a substitute where recipes call for xanthan gum.  Xanthan gum is much more expensive.  I use it 1:1 as a replacement & works great (& has no corn derivatives)."
"Gene Pope ""gene""",B004JRKEH4,Yum! (maybe),"Like most food products this will either fit your tastes or it won't. It has a nice smokey chipotle taste, a little bit of a kick but not all that hot. Very creamy but a slight texture of granularity can be felt, just like they ground up real chipotle peppers.  I like it."
DW,B000LKTCVW,I love them,"I always buy two cases of Pemmican bars, one chocolate and one fruit & nut. When they arrive, I put them into the freezer and take one out whenever I want to take one for lunch at work. It is defrosted by then and ready to eat. I really like the fact that it is not too sweet."
"Vickie L. Kneisler ""Vickie""",B003ZXAMPW,On a diet and these are scrumptious!!!,I love these crackers for an in between snack and it fills me up too.  Thanks SPECIAL K FOR ALL YOUR GREATPRODUCTS FOR PEOPLE ON DIETS OR WATCHING THEIR WEIGHT.
OlyNomad,B000H0ZJIG,Dogs love them.,"My dogs love these treats, they are perfect for training.  And small enough that you can use many without them packing on the pounds during training."
"VW ""ValiOcean""",B000JMDH9A,Not 'Powdery',"I bought this to make coconut milk for my coffee.  But it doesn't turn into milk, even in a blender.  The bits are too big - made me choke on my coffee.  Will never reorder."
Super Trader,B0041CIP3M,Delicious!,My family loved this quick dinner kit. In 20 minutes our rice was done the curry had simmered and we were ready to eat. Instead of the beef recommended we used chicken breast cut into hearty chunks. This blended well with the sweetslightly spicy curry mix. We would defintely order and eat it again. There are no draw backs that we could see and we were pleasantly surprised that this was a product of Singapore.
Paul Wang,B0020ALBS8,This product is dog food not a snack for humans,I was looking for heathy sweet potato chips and see this item.  Ordered it quickly and had to return it because itis for dogs not for humans.I have nothing against dogs or dog food.  But I think the Amazon website needs to make a clearer distinctionbetween dog snacks and human snacks and not list them all on the same page for people to choose.
Courtney,B0029NGX34,All animals love it,"This is the best for all the animals.  The dogs love it to.  When someone is sick and needs to get eating, this is a great way to get them to it.  Not the cheapest cat food out there but if you want the best this is it."
paa0023,B000OYIDMY,Yummy!,"It was great, but the original flavors weren't in there. I was expecting grape, but it was something different. I also realized you can get the same laffy taffy box at sams for $6. Basically this is a rip off."
William S. Wolston,B001FYUVKE,Chloe loves them!,"Our Boston Terrier loves these bones - we give them to her as a treat or to keep her busy when we have company.  For a 16 lbs. dog she's a mighty chewer and these last her a couple of hours, with breaks to investigate if she's missing anything!  We'll buy more of these!"
Carol A. Chriswell,B001E5E2RW,"Torani Sugar-Free Syrup, Caramel","Thanks Amazon for offering this item on autoship.  We use it in our coffee every morning.  Delicious!!!!!!!Because it is sugar-free, I feel no guilt.  Also we add whipped cream to make the coffee taste like starbucks.  Yummy......."
Luvssassy,B005K4Q1T0,Keurig hot chocolate,I have tried several types of hot chocolate since purchasing my Keurig and this is by far the one I enjoy the most.  I have it shipped every month so that I don't worry about running out!!!
Yasmin Steinke,B001VT8K7E,"Delicious, Sweet and Non-Acidic",Thank you for quick delivery and wonderful customer service on the Roland Balsamic Vinegar of Modena.  I really have enjoyed this Balsamic Vinegar on Salads.
Aleesha Burgess,B001HWD2OG,Dog is not a fan,"My dog loves the chicken, steak, and peanut butter booda bones, but he's not as fond of the spearmint/peppermint variety.  My dog will eat it if offered, but my dad's dog who I often sit for will not even touch these.  I wouldn't recommend for a dog who prefers meat."
V. Block,B001HN5Z4K,Ripley and Daisy love these!,"These a little jerky bites, about 1 1/2"" x 3/4"". They are chewy and smell really good, very smoky. They are thankfully made in the USA. Both of my dogs love these."
Arthur,B0049W4QEG,Very Small,Opened the box and could not believe how small this was. The picture is very deceiving. The pot is probably two inches by 2 inches.If you want a super small project this is perfect for you but I was expecting something more
decaf in PA,B008YA1DZE,Pretty good,"I was looking for Coffee People cups but as i was told they dnt make them anymore so,this was ok for me."
Jill Guntur,B001LG945O,A flavor winner,"I usually cringe a little before I do a natural juice/carbonated beverage.  There is frequently something of an aftertaste that is unpleasant.This is refreshing, light, very bubbly and leaves a bright taste after with no cringe effects.I definitely would buy this drink."
"Tim Drake ""Author and Journalist""",B002TMV3CG,Disappointing Blend,"I do not know whether our product was out-dated, but my wife and I were both very disappointed in this brand of coffee. It had a bitter taste and simply wasn't what we had hoped. In comparison to other dark roast brands, I simply cannot recommend this one. We did not care for the flavor."
"L REN ""laurenelise00""",B0047ZEXN4,My dogs like them but they don't last too long....,These pork hide bones seem high quality and my dogs like them but they are 75 lb and 87 lb dogs so they don't last more than 15 min per bone. I am not sure that the 20 bones are gonna last in my house long at all. Wish they sold these same bones but much larger sized for large breed dogs. These bones would be perfect for 20 to 40 lb dogs
KennyT,B0090X8IPM,Doesn't taste as good as I thought,"I had originally thought that this Starbucks coffee will taste as good as the ones they sell at their stores. But it is not as good. The coffee doesn't taste as strong as other coffee (like Blue Mtn Hawaii coffee). Overall, you pay for what you get. I paid a discounted price on this, and I got a lesser quality product."
"Clare Guydish ""Going Places""",B000IXUK2W,Best candy bar ever,My son rated this as approved for heaven...and this is one picky kid...doesn't eat sweets much and is very finicky about everything he eats
"Karen Walker ""fedupwcrap""",B002Q8PQAS,Happy dogs,These biscuits are real favorites of my small CKC and my GSD. usually they don't like me to change their treats but these were lpve at first sniff and the vendors were quick and very courteous.
Michael Ledo,B009RB4GO4,SPICY AND FLAVORFUL,"This is more spicy and flavorful than the Green Mountain brand. For those that enjoy a robust flavored cider, this is the one. I obtained mine from the local Walmart for $7.98"
