"Michele ""shivanslayer""",B001D09KAM,OUTSTANDING FLAVOR,This is a product that goes beyond the 5 Star review - The bars are absolutely delicious.  I just ordered some to be sent to my son at college.  I definitely will be back for more and the Cranberry Almond is a flavor explosion when you bite into it.  A truly wonderful product.
"J. Shockley ""Kansas Born!!""",B00076KWQY,Sunflower Cookies,I ordered 10 packages and they didn't last long. Delicious!!Excellent Customer Service! Quick Ship! Well boxed.Thank you for offering on-line.  I will order more in future.  = )
British Reader,B001E5E2AE,You'll never go back....,"to using bouillon cubes once you've used and tasted this great product.You'll also wonder why you've been taking pantry space for years with cartons and cans. This is an amazingly simple and easy-to-use packaging concept (no scissors, no can-opener) for a first-rate chicken broth with a really deep home-made taste. The Beef version is excellent too."
"Beverly ""Beverly""",B003X0RUN4,The best,"This is the best terriyaki sauce I have found.  It is so hard to find the terriyaki sauce, plenty of the other sauces, but I have a receipe for this only.  I make a sauce for chicken wings.  I am so happy to find it here at Amazon.  Thanks Amazon."
wonderer,B00002N8SM,Doesn't work!! Don't waste your money!!,Worst product I have gotten in long time. Would rate it as no star if I could.  Simply did not catch a single fly or bug of any sort.  Went to the hardware store and bought the old-fashioned spiral fly paper which was very effective.  Had an unuasual influx of flys in the house this fall and needed to do something.
Hervian Rose,B008O3G2K2,I can't get my dogs to lick the container.,"Maybe because we have all working dogs, it's hard to get them to take treats from the hand, and they won't lick the roller.  Then I rolled it on their muzzle like an antiperspirant they seemed to like it.It's a great idea and a wonderful product to use if your pet will cooperate. It is clean, you can keep it in your pocket and not end up with little bits of kibble in the laundry.Our dogs are Great Pyrenees and Border Collie.  I'd love to hear how it works with other breeds."
meadeweber,B003VXFK44,Good coffee,"Good flavor.  Coconut flavor is subtle and not overpowering.  In comparison, there is another coconut coffee by Green Mountain in which the coconut flavor is overdone in my opinion."
Steve,B0041QEP4Q,Great pasta,"I have tried many different types of pasta, whole wheat, spelt, gluten-free. This einkorn based pasta is tasty and is packed with protein and fiber. I like my pasta al dente, but I found that you have to cook it longer than is indicated on the package otherwise it's a bit too hard. I no longer feel guilty having some pasta!"
Eco-Friendly Feng Shui Designer,B001CRSR0U,Yummy!,"For a prepared soup, this was very good. Perfectly spiced. I ate it as soup, but you could pour it on some basmati rice, add a green, and you have dinner."
T. Williams,B005GIF5UQ,My kitten loves these!,"These are the only treats I feed my 4 month old kitten. I usually give him 3 treats, 3 times a day.  When it's time for his treat, I yell ""Treat, treat, treat!"" and he come running!"
Fran I. Sugarman,B000EUF9CK,WAY too strong,"I put one square in my mouth and it made me want to vomit. I love most of their other products but this was absolutely volatile. The taste was stuck in my mouth for the rest of the night. Unless you like your chocolate very very very very very dark, do not get this. 88% cacao content is ridiculous- I try to stay below 70-75."
V. Block,B001OCKIP0,"Very, very good","This is an excellent granola. The chunks of granola are large. The semi-sweet chocolate is wonderful with the granola, and the granola is not very sweet. A great combination of flavors."
Janet Davis,B000Z8RZ3M,Maniac Magee,I was very pleased with the butterscotch krimpets. I wanted to use them in my classroom to give my kids a taste of what Jerry Spenelli was talking about in his book Maniac Magee. The kids loved them.
Michael Stefancic,B001JG537O,SOY-Goood!,This are so damn delicious..great texture and taste.  I first tried them at the Toronto Veggie Festival summer 2007 but haven't been able to find them locally since.  Hope Amazon stocks more soon.
Jamie Justice,B000G6TS74,Twin Boys love it,"Our twin boys have been eating this for breakfast from day one of solids(now 22mos old).  We usually blend up some fresh fruit, a little whole milk, and this oatmeal for breakfast.  Only difference from day one of trying it, is that they feed themselves now.  This is an awesome, wholesome, organic choice for parents, and I highly recommend it."
Darj117,B000TRFGGM,Small,"It only lasted 2 days. Came mostly dead. Glad it was only 10 bucks. It was also very small so. The flies I wanted it to eat , it couldn't."
Patricia,B001BM68QG,Favorite tea,Love the delicate flavor of this green tea I 've tried other green teas but all of those seemed bitter by comparison. Good Earth's Lemongrass teas has been my favorite daily tea for years now.  Do follow the instructions on the box(or tea bag) for the best flavor.
"Mary McKinney ""PRINCESS MERI""",B001EO5WJK,ROCK CANDY ON A STICK,"Rock candy for grown-ups!A Delicious snack!Although these are pure sugar,it is pure cane sugar. Sugarin its natural state hasnutritional properties.An occasional treat oruse to sweeten coffee, hot cocoa, etc.A great stocking stuffer forkids of all ages!"
S. Baker,B00474GXH4,Spicy and delicious!,"I tried the first packet of salsa mix the other day and made salsa for some friends coming over. Rave reviews all round! This salsa mix definitely has a bite to it which I really like. It was super easy to use, cut up tomatoes and throw in the mix, can't get any easier than that! I did add some fresh cilantro though, to spruce it up. Was delicious and fresh tasting with chips and all the ladies were asking what my secret recipe was. Great product."
Domestic Engineer,B001XQXZG6,Love this tea!,I love this tea! It has a mild spice-like flavor. It is high in antioxidants and great for the immune system. My nutritionist recommended it for me when I had a sinus infection to loosen up some of my congestion and boost my immune system. It is now my favorite tea and my tea of choice.
goodsign,B000V5X0MO,Salad Dressing?,"This is OK, but I wouldn't buy it again.It does have a garlic hint, but too much sugar. More like a dressing than a mustard."
sss147,B00020HHK4,delicious,"This tea is great.  I cook it in gallon batches and sweeten it with agave nectar and keep it in the fridge.  I guess it ""worked"" because my daughter was born after just 4 hours of labor and 20 minutes of pushing.  I'm still drinking it since I had just ordered another 3-pack of boxes of it the day before our baby was born.  My husband loves the tea too and he doesn't even have a uterus."
Susiemm,B003Z6ZGZK,Always good,I consistantly use Starbucks Via at work. They allow me to be able to make a great cup of coffee in less than a minute.
Shellibug2000,B0029NN184,So convenient!,This is the same product we buy at the pet store but it is much cheaper and is more convenient to have it delivered every month!
"J. Ameyde ""Amazon Queen""",B000R9P99G,Amazing little biscotti!,The Italian market around the corner from us always runs out of these biscotti.  Now I have a new connection with Amazon Prime!
D. Rogers,B003ZNXCKE,More of a treat,"Good product, but more of a treat for my dogs.  It took them just a matter of minutes to have the SmartBone gone.  Maybe good for dogs that are not big chewers.  I was hoping for something more digestible but as sturdy as rawhides"
bella22,B00370ESNU,Cough Syrup,"Unfortunately this soda tastes like cough syrup.  I was really hopeful for this but the cough syrup taste is horrible.  It was fine as a soda, but the flavor was horrible."
"C. Eallonardo ""Kali's Copilot""",B00004RYGX,Good Tim Burton Flick,"I like Tim Burton movies in general.  But this is a good one too if you're just into movies.  It's funny, and has great visuals (for the time it was made)."
angel,B002XF23PU,Cadbury chocolates are wonderful,"I've tried many different chocolates - including different types of Cadbury'sand my favorites are the flake, roses and eclairs. The chocolate flavor tastesnatural (not waxy) smooth and I'm never disappointed"
"Dianna Strickland ""CLASSIC MOVIE JUNKIE""",B000YUQUM8,Yummy,"The only place that sells this product is SAM""S. The hazelnut is soo good. We also put it in oatmeal, pancake batter gives them a extra flavor. Thee Problem is SAM'S seems to only ordering the french vanilla for now. That has no taste at all.Coffee-Mate Hazelnut (concentrated) with Pump, 50.7-Ounce Units (Pack of 2)"
Jerry Watkins,B0098WV8F2,Great for PB addicts on a diet,I could eat peanut butter by the jar. When I'm looking to lose weight this is the stuff to go to. Having to measure out the powder and water to get the right consistency keeps me from binging on it. It is also fantastic to mix into smoothies or supplement powders for added flavor. Excited about the potential other uses for this product!
aletseg,B007JFMH8M,Delicious!!,This is a very tasty cookie!!!!! I really enjoyed it and i just love oatmeal cookies and quaker oats its a good brand.
"L. S. Cooper ""nmsusieq""",B000REI2X6,Great Buy,They are exactly as advertised.  And simply the best jelly beans around.  How many flavors?  I can't even keep count.
David Roper,B000GAWH4G,Heaven in a bottle,"Really worth the extra, can always tell when I am out of this item, really makes the baked product stand out."
willie55,B001SAVJW4,Best wing sauce out there,"I still do not understand all the hype on Franks hot sauce.  It has a very strong biting taste that is not very desirable.  I went out looking for a new wing sauce and came across Ashanti chicken wing sauce.  It was everything I was looking for, heat and incredible flavor.  I do not have to look anymore, I found the perfect sauce."
M. Peters,B002U1HU7S,Best Hot Sauce Ever,"I love Hot Sauce and being of West Indian decent, this is one of the better hot sauces, the extra hot is gooooood."
"Lou Pranzitelli ""loupranz""",B000FDDETG,Best Tasting,We want you to know that we are very pleased with the quality of service your company provides. We sincerely appreciate your responsiveness and the way you conduct business. We have recommended your company to others because of our satisfaction with your service & product. We look forward to doing business with you for years to come.
"P. Musselman ""Super Mom""",B000E46GFA,They are Great,We love Envirokidz! All their items are great and the price on Amazon is the best.
"S. Weiss ""shwony""",B000LKTVCC,A very tasty chip!,"These chips are crisp, tangy and a nice change from barbecue flavor chips.  If you like spicy foods, you'll love these.  The blue cheese is not at all overwhelming, just adds that extra ""bite.""  The box of chips arrived well packed, nothing broken, and the expiration date was over 3 months in advance, making this a very good value, considering the 20% discount Amazon had during November."
Gooey,B005HI55CS,Once is enough.,"Not as good as the reviews led me to expect. Despite great color and good viscosity, the syrup's flavor lacked intensity.  I'll continue my quest elsewhere."
Ribqueen,B001FWXM16,A key ingredient in my new favorite BBQ sauce for chicken!,"For the past 30 years, I've preferred an old family BBQ sauce recipe for my chicken - but NO LONGER! Combine 4 oz of this rich and flavorful syrup with 5 TB chili sauce, one small onion (chopped), 2 TB apple cider vinegar, 1 TB regular mustard, and 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce. Marinate your favorite chicken parts in a covered dish in the fridge for at least four hours, turning the chicken pieces occasionally. Grill chicken until thoroughly cooked, basting occasionally. DELISH!!!"
Victoria R. Solmon,B000H7FZ3S,Great!,"I've been an avid tea drinker since I was a kid, so I can say I'm a little picky.  Dr. Oz recommended organic oolong to perk up metabolism (I think), so I thought I'd try this one.  It is a great price and the quality of tea is excellent.  I can't imagine what happened to the other reviewer's order so that it was all powdery, etc.Give it a try, I don't think you'll be disappointed!"
Carl W Wilcox,B002C54UK2,GREAT COFFEE,We have been drinking this coffee for several months now and love it. We like the whole bean so we can grind as needed.
Trinity Leigh Barnosky,B000LKTXHA,Delicious!,"I am really enjoying this bread.  We got this one and the fitness bread, both are good.  Great toasted with peanut butter for breakfast."
David,B000G32YEG,"Hot, but not the best flavor","For a snack, these are just okay.  They are, in my opinion, really hot.  Burn your nose kind of hot.  I like to put wasabi paste on my sushi and burn my nose a little, so I don't really have a complaint about the hotness, it's just not exactly the flavor I was expecting.  Wasabe peas (not this product) seem to have the right flavor, but these dry roasted edamame just don't have it.  And like the other reviewer said, it needs salt.  Maybe that would help a little."
Ron,B005IOXR1M,Mrs. Mitchell,Love the apple cider wish you could get it in stores.  I would drink more but have to order by mail and hate the wait.
S. Roth,B000EDDSE8,"fremont, ca","This is a great product.  I've already purchased this product several times and love it.  It's reasonably priced compared to other grocery stores, like Whole Food Market.  I stored the entire order in the freezer to retain the freshness of the flaxseed meal. I sprinkle it in my oatmeal for omega-3 fatty acids supplement.Would purchase it again in the future.  Recommend for people who are vegan."
Anana,B00292BM7W,The doggie loves them,"There were more treats in the box than I expected!I like the shape of them, and that you can split them down the middle almost like a pill.They're about the size of large vitamins, which is perfect for my Westie mix.We tried the Chicken & Cherries kind, and our dog just loves them!Will definitely buy again."
Jacksmom,B0007A0AQM,mini naturals,My dog loves these. They are very small pieces so I think that is why my fifteen pound dog loves them so much
tony,B00427KO62,tony,these are great treats for the dog. we have been purchasing them for years. the dog really enjoys them and they keep it's teeth clean.
