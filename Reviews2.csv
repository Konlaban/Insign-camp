"Linda Joy ""Blueiijoy""",B000M9OE6K,Nice Gift To Give,"Gave this to my cousin and his wife the past two years.  They were very pleased with the cakes they received (and would send me pics of the cakes as they received them). Liked that we could send it quarterly, rather than monthly.  Just wish there was a little more variety in the cakes.  Nonetheless, great gift for that ""difficult to buy"" person on your list."
Sean,B0034L8URM,One of the best tasting protein bars,"While these may not be the healthiest protein bar out there, they are definitely one of the best tasting. These really do taste like a cinnamon bun, and nuke 'em for a few seconds and you have a delicious treat."
Larry Lawler,B005V9UG18,Great meal replacement shake,"I love the taste of this shake, it is better than chocolate milk, and when I am hungry it talks away the feeling for a few hours.  I have this shake setup now with Amazon auto-ship now, as the store called: mother's doesn't seem to keep in regular supply"
"P. Payne ""Loves Perfume""",B000ICPV4K,Too bland,"This coffee is bland and somewhat weak to me.  But I'm a Starbucks fan - so I really enjoy the full flavor, richness, and even burnt flavor that those coffees offer.  So you could read this - if I enjoy Starbucks then I most likely will not be so crazy about this coffee; if I really think Starbucks is horrible then there's a chance I'll like this."
D,B000ER5EKA,Good snack for school,"This is a good healthy option for a snack. Our daughter likes them, but doesn't constantly ask for them either.  They are also nut free, which means I can send them to her school for snacks and lunch.  It can be hard to find good nut free products, so I have a standing order on these."
Arctic Highlander,B003ZS18GE,Bitter lime taste,This has a strongly bitter taste of lime when made as directed.  Definitely not a natural made from scratch taste.  It made the worst tasting Margaritas that I've ever had.  My initial response is to just pour the rest of it down the drain and cut my losses.  I'm glad I only bought one bottle to try.
L. Joan,B000N2848K,"A wonderful product, and a terrific present!","This will be our third year purchasing fudge and truffles from the Brigittine Monks.  We give boxes as Christmas presents, and everyone LOVES it!  Our friends and family say that it is the best chocolate they have had in a long time, and we agree.  The monks are great to work with, and shipping was reasonable, especially considering the amount of fudge and truffles we bought!  Friends and family have gone on to order for THEIR friends and family."
Moon Glough,B004VLVOJ0,toast 12 minutes on cookie sheet in oven,"i toast these on a cookie sheet at 400 in the oven for 12 minutes. i toast enough for a week's breakfasts. then i put one portion in the blender and grind. pour into bowl. add boiling water. voila! instant hot oatmeal! add any flavoring you usually add to cereals.btw i tried to sprout these and they did not sprout. i ate the soaked groats raw though, and they tasted good."
"Clyde Fulton Mallard ""xlduck""",B00437X5DU,not satisfied,the chocolet was melted and of shape It tasted alright after I put in the  refrigerator for a few hours.
"Mary-Ann ""mag89""",B0083QJU0O,Yummy,"I have tried several different brands of pure maple syrup, but this one is my favorite.  It smells and tastes heavenly.  We don't use lots of it, but it keeps in the refrigerator for months."
Lady Di,B0009XUAX0,Super Seller,Great products. Easy to deal with. I order from them over and over as they are hassle free; have great prices and ship fast. What more could a buyer ask for in a seller?
Frank Jodlowski,B000FXYLQ6,Delicious,These are the original bars I remember from when I was a kid and they are delicious!  Lots of peanuts and a little to hold it together - good for travel.
"Kristina M. Solch ""Kristina""",B00141NFVA,Wonderful!,"Dogswell is such a wonderful company. Their products are great, and my collie loves everything! (She's a picky eater!)"
Lori A. Vosters,B005K4Q1YA,Kuerig Cappuccino,I love my Kuerig and especially love the variety of drinks that I am able to make with it. Product was just as stated and arrived in a timely manner.
Perla,B000EQT574,Chips 4 R Salsa Gift Baskets,"We're a upcoming Authentic Mexican Style Salsa Company formerly from Tucson, Arizona, now located in Bend, Oregon. We wanted to make gift baskets for our customers and needed products to fill them. The Garden of Eatin' Blue Tortilla Chips fit the theme and hit the mark. We will continue with this product for any additional Gift Baskets we'll need as our business grows. SouthwestSalsaCo.com"
Eman,B0001IOSDQ,best bbq rub,"Great rub for the bbq. Longer you let it set the better. I did two days. If roasting add a little water, because the meat will have its own juices. Great Great!!!!!!"
"Beth Wisser ""Beth""",B000HDOQ5U,An acquired taste,This cereal is just ok. It is good if you want a very low sugar cereal but the pellets are so tiny. It has a slightly nutty flavor but at the same time it is pretty bland (low sugar). If you want no sweetness at all in your cereal you will like this. It tastes a little bit like grape nuts but not as dense. The way I eat it is mix it with other cereals to give an extra crunch.
Scots-Irish Lass (terri),B000AXWVQS,Delicious!,Had this the first time in Costa Rica and almost cried as I shook the last few drops from the last remaining bottle I had brought back with me.Did a Google search to find a place to purchase more within the USA and followed the link to Amazon!Better than A1 hands down!!  I wouldn't call this a 'salsa' - more like a steak sauce that's great on any meat or fowl
"Paula M. Chernikov ""Paula M.""",B000EEJLTS,Renaisance Czar Nicholas II tea.,"It's a great product, the best tea I ever tasted.I bought for my friends and they loved it very much and asking to get more of that tea. My friend are actually coffe drinkers, now drinking that tes a lot.Really great product."
I Teach Typing,B005VOOM2W,Light and tasty,"If you appreciate coffee with a social conscience and you want a delicious light blend, this is for you. The little pods are fine for making a 4 oz coffee but anything larger will be too pale for most people's taste. So, while the coffee is very good, you will likely need to use two of the bags to get your morning buzz. The packaging is an entertaining read that gives you snippets about the Marley family and the origin of the coffee. Plan on waking up to a lovely day while your supply lasts."
wolsen,B001EPQO32,the best in the world,This is the best dipping oil I have ever had!!!!My local store quit carrying it. I am so happy that I found it again that I ordered 10 bottles.
rjacobson1@aol.com,B001BOOKW8,Guilt free and delicious,"Licorettes are guilt-free and delicious pastilles, full of flavor and chewy goodness.  Only 25 calories for the entire box.  it's not the cheapest alternative, but for weight-conscious licorice-lovers, or even casual fans, it's a terrific choice."
"James Alexander II ""beagle 1174""",B000W5N2D0,Review,"Product was excellent really seemd to help my dog, however the price was very high for the little amount received. I found a much bigger bag locally at a better rate. Would buy again though!"
"J. Gilbert ""Tech Geek with a cooking flair""",B000V9NKYS,A bit of a weak Gensing tea,"I bought this expecting a bit sharper of a gensing flavor. Other than a weaker flavor that what I wanted, it is still a decent tea."
"Debra Chong ""ECommerceMaven""",B001BCVY9W,Great chow for a gourmet kitty!,"This cat food looks and smells more like people food. My cat, who is quite finicky, ate two cans of this in one sitting. It looks like there are no additives or filler, just chicken and a clear tasty sauce for the cat. Really GREAT."
MTCBells,B002HQCWYM,Excellent tea,"I wasn't sure if it was going to be as good as the regular tea bags that you brew, but it was awesome.  Took me back to my trip to London."
AnneB,B0051WA1H4,Awesome popcorn!,Bought this popcorn because it looked good. It is sooooo good. When you put it in your mouth you feel like your mouth is full. It is a pleasure to chew and a little of this popcorn is better than a whole bowl of regular popcorn. My family is sold on mushroom popcorn.
"Ms. Tess L. Brantley ""Tess Brantley cat lover""",B0034EFIYC,great bars,"These bars are great as is your company. I love to get these bars, they are good to have when you just want a little something sweet, not too many cals."
P. Houglum,B006N3I0DM,Disappointing,"I expected more with this chef's name on this product, but the flavor was blah. I even thought the first cup I tasted was a little fishy in its flavor. Tastes like a cup I would expect from Folgers and other common brands."
"C. Gampala ""Chaksuk""",B000FPKX4S,Wish it could be healthier,This snack is filling and my son likes it but I wish it had less sugar and was more healthy!
Roger Westfall,B0029JZP7S,Not the same,They had to go and change the recipe. I used to buy this in the smaller package when I would travel to work back in the early 80's. I guess they've new and improved it because it isn't the same and doesn't taste near as good.
Kimberly D. Karau,B0015DMKGI,satisfied,Big League Chew Sour Apple 12 Pack Box  I was happy with the service I recieved..
J. Hayes,B0041HSG54,terrible cookies,I've eaten a lot of different gluten free cookies and these are by far one of the worst. The dough part has NO flavor.  The only flavor of the cookie is from the chocolate chips - and that's hard to mess up. The texture is decent - there's just no taste.
J. Gregg,B0040PWW84,can peaches,these can peach slices taste real good really can not say much more then that other reviews say it all will be buying more well worth he money shipped and rec on time.
A. Jarvis,B0028H1H4Q,So refreshing,"This is the best tasting mint green tea. After hearing so much about the health benefits of green tea, I want to drink more of it. I have always found straight green tea to have a bit of a ""fishy"" taste but the mint really makes it taste much better."
Lauried1079,B007OSBE1U,Best Keurig Pods I Have Tried!,"I bought the original Keurig and probably have  tested every brand I could find. If you love bold coffee without a bitter taste - This one is THE BEST!! It was night and day compared to Emerils, Gloria Jean, Carabou, etc.I like Starbucks pods but they are overpriced. This is definitely as good and 1/2 the price :)"
Ronald Pawkett,B000G6Q4FI,The Best Chips Ever,These chips are the greatest. I have ordered them several times--everyone loves them. Buying them on Amazon saves you money-much less that the cost from my local store.
"Law Lady ""Educator""",B0000DJDJZ,Delicious,Tasty product with very low carb and sugar content. Ideal for those monitoring blood sugar. This brand is the best of its type on the market. Fast shipping.
"John West ""pianodave""",B003JA5KLM,excellent product,"This is excellent product, great for coffee lovers. The K-cups are very consistent and considering the price, much better than a trip to the coffee shop."
Sree,B00185XICS,My Pup Luvs HK,"My Snoopy (Miniature American Eskimo) is very picky when it comes to food but she loves loves loves Honest Kitchen food. I have tried Force, Thrive, Keen and Zeal so far and Snoopy loved all of them equally.I usually give her Zeal in the morning; Thrive or Force at night... that way she doesn't get bored with her food"
Janice Roof,B000634HCI,Dog likes it fine,This formula seems to actually be vegan. My dog has been eating this for several years now and it has completely eliminated her constipation.
madam,B000NP10GU,Great coffee,It is a very nice coffee with exceptional body and flavor. It is not bitter at all. Tastes great and will continue to purchase as long as it is available
"Marblehead ""Steve""",B0002QF27I,"Malomars, Yum!","Great service and they're hard to find where I reside.  I ordered a whole case of these things for my friend as a ""get well"" gift following an injury he suffered.  He's happy and healed!"
Valerie Franek,B0018KNGDY,Yuck!,"This was the first Larabar product that I tried, and it was awful!  The bar smelled and tasted like Vicks Vaporub, which is not exactly a pleasant thing when you're talking about food.  I will definitely not be purchasing any of their other products after this awful experience."
Prophetic_Joe,B001EQ4O38,Favorite Decaf,"I simply love this coffee, nice solid flavor with some butterscotch notes. Great for making a nice latte or cappuccino late at night. I have seriously become addicted to this."
"Amy ""Amy""",B001ULH7P4,Great Snack,"My daughter really enjoys these healthy little snacks. They also do not make a mess, which is great for me."
tinarie,B001EQ4P2I,Fantastic!,These almonds are so yummy! I ordered them online because both of my stores were always out. Walmart and Target is where I get them. I go through these very quickly. I like spicy foods so to me they are not hot but just right.
Carly,B0009ETA6W,Increased milk supply,My doctor recommended that I try Fenugreek to increase my milk supply. Within 24 hours I noticed an increase. After about a week I was able to freeze one bag of milk every other day. I am going to continue to take this supplement as I return to work to keep my supply up. I take 2 capsules 3 times a day.
Norma D. Wright,B000FBOAO6,Almond Thins,I really love these wafer cookies.  Why can't I get them directly from [...] with my regular orders from them?Wouldn't that be less expensive for you and for me and for the environment?
Heather Lynn Anderson,B000U96JEC,Love it,"I am a really picky eater.  This is by far the best bottled salad dressing I've ever had.  And the fact that its no calories, no fat makes it even better! Thanks to this dressing and some salad, I'm able to easily stick to my diet.  Thank you Walden Farms!"
