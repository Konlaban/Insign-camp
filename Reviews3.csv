"Michael Mcclure ""Timer""",B001EQ4P2I,Simply the BEST!!!,Our order arrived yesterday and this morning we placed an order for more - the taste is addictive!!  Just enough punch and spice.
Cupcakes,B0061UQ6ME,Starbucks house blend k-cups,Very pleased with our order.  Coffee was fresh and an excellent choice.  Would order again.  The price was better then we could find in our area.
"KC ""Amazon Customer""",B000BLLWCS,good product,The item was exactly as described and was received in a timely manner. The only problem was that the 3 items were packed too tight so that one of the containers broke and spilled into the shipping box...The box was sealed so that there was no problem in product quality. Will buy from them again
"Wendy K. Mueller ""53722sam""",B000E1FXNY,americana instant custard pudding,"I have been searching for years for the instant version of americana custard pudding. I am allergic to eggs and this was the only egg free product I could eat, and I loved it. Just mix it in a blender with milk, refrigerate and enjoy. Always got compliments from guests too. Now the americana cook and serve I'm sure is great, but what happened to my instant?"
John E. Harris,B000H9K3EW,sugar alcohol good and bad,"Dear Amazon,I have purchased s/f black licorice from Amazon and I love it!  The problem is that the sweetener (sugar alcohol) causes me the worse gas (flatulence) I have ever experienced!  What exactly is the problem?  And is there a solution?  Sinderely,  John Harris  [...]"
"ferrethouse ""ferrethouse""",B001RVFERK,Popchips,"Love the Popchips.  Less calories then regular chips, so you can eat more.  Cheddar kinda tastes like a white cheddar to me."
Richard Fiske,B000PVV7X8,One of the best,"Was happy to see Amazon carry this granola - at one to two dollars a bag cheaper than what I typically see at the store.  Even as a single guy, six bags aren't going to last that long."
"Stephanie ""Aussie in USA""",B001JDHUUA,Bless you Amazon,Thank you for making Vegemite available. Now just offer the larger jar sizes and I'll really be a Happy Little Vegemite.
"E. Paches ""elsa""",B002J75TG2,Preserve peach with a lot of mildew - returned,"Do not buy this item from this supplier.  I cannot believed my eyes when I opened the bottle.  There was a thick green stuff so I checked the label and realized that it was a mildew.  Because of this, I will never buy food from Amazon again and I do a lot of shopping from Amazon."
P. MacDonald,B001VIYCK4,Best cat food ever?,Wow if i knew how much cats would love this stuff i would have been feeding it to any and all of my cats long ago.  You would think it was wet food the way my kitty chows it down.  I got it because he had gingivitus and i had to spend quite a bit to have his teeth worked on.  The vet told me his teeth are still looking nice and clean a few months later!
"S. Arya ""SA""",B001EPQVEO,"Out of date Peanuts, expired","I ordered these 3 times and the expiry date on all of them was Jan 2012. Not sure why they did this, very disappointed."
Marion L. Kunkle,B001L4JH5I,Two years I have been using Pamela's Bread Mix and I am very satisfied.  The bread is easy to make and very tasty.,"I have added Italian Seasoning,onion and garlic powderto the batter, very tasty.  Scant on the oil."
Consumer Advocate,B001D0KG5K,Wonderful,"I have tried several pumkin flavored coffees, & found none that could come close to Green Mountain's fall seasonal offering of ""Pumkin Spice"".However, I find this one equally as good.  I will always buy this one since to me, there is little difference in flavor, if any that I can detect, (not to mention it is about one half the price).  Thanks Amazon for offering this.  I absolutely love this coffee."
TLR,B000UXY2EC,Last time I ordered it sucked.,"First two times I ordered the milk was awesome.  Last time I ordered two cases they were all smashed and the milk was horrible.  I was unable to return it because amazon said it was nonreturnable. The first two times I got the milk I would have given five stars, now I would advise against buying it.  They can't even stand by their product by allowing a return on a bad batch."
Deadwood,B0015TFTB0,wonderful coffee and perfect size pouch,"The Gevalia dark roast is one of the best coffees I have ever had.  It is bold yet smooth and is great at any time, even in the morning.  I really love the pouches, they are the perfect size for the full pot that I make so there is no chance of measuring the wrong amount of coffee for the pot.  Also it is great to just be able to open the pouch and pour the coffee in the filter when i am sleepy in the morning."
T. Mayer,B002MAWZX6,Good but not a Brownie,These are very good but not like a brownie.  It is a chocolate muffin with a nut topping.  I followed the directions as stated on the back of the box except I used a 12 count muffin pan sprayed with butter flavored cooking spray.  They did not stick and made a pretty good size muffin.  I will play with the amount of water and egg whites next time to try to make a more brownie like batter.  If that works out I would defiantly buy them again.
Penelope Helenick Addy,B00141OX52,Best Dog Treats Around at Amazon,"Besides being tasty, Happy Hips is good for your dog. It's a quality product by a great company dedicated to making only the best food and treats. Also, by signing up for recurring shipments, you are saving money. It's win, win, win."
Matthew G Hilla,B004FRLTMW,Good - but not great,"While this makes a decent Root beer, it doesn't quite have that deep flavorful ""bite"" you would expect out of a natural root beer at this price. Using the recommended mix - it just tastes ""thin"".  Adding more to compensate and it is just too sweet. My personal preference is more  Sassafras root, and deeper flavor...While it beats the majority of the big brands in flavor -- but it doesn't hold up against the other naturals."
Mary S. Clark,B000MAK3UA,Not 1-WW Point!,"I ordered this item because the 1-point WW popcorn is hard to find in the stores; and when i received it last night, it was the 3-point WW popcorn.  I was sent the wrong item; but the popcorn is delicious."
"K. Stuckey ""kateling""",B000M2UNI0,cheaper than warehouse club,"I love taking Pop-Tarts to school, great snack for energy. This order keeps me going for weeks."
John Weissman,B002SZRR1A,"Okay taste, but pricely","The question about any product is always, Is it worth it's price? Here, no. THe tea's taste is reviewed elsewhere, so check it out, and maybe it's standard practice by certain connie suers to ignore price, but I never do. I gave it a try, like it, but won't buy it again. Tastes tannicky. I'll stick to Barry's, and that's double what Trader Joe's Irish Breakfast cost, which is pretty good itself."
R. Ocasio,B008S5KZWM,Great Flavor but Bottle Top Hassle,"I used it in a Moqueca which is a Brazilian Fish Stew, and it was very delicious. The problem I had was with the bottle top. The recipe called for 1/4 c of the oil. Unfortunately, I was unable to remove the plastic top which does not unscrew.  It just has a flip top cap with a single hole in it and ended up just shaking it by drops into the measuring cup which was messy and a hassle."
Lindsaylouella,B000EGSUMA,MADE IN CHINA!,I was VERY excited to find this snack and opened it right away. They tasted amazing & I couldn't believe the great price for the product! THEN I found out they are MADE IN CHINA! You've got to be kidding me! I seriously have a problem with that & will be returning the products from Mr's May's that I've yet to open. I cannot believe they are stating they're a all natural healthy snack. Who even knows what's really in them!
TAMI,B002W9BLKU,"The best ""feel good"" energy drink!","I happened to stumble upon this drink, trying to find a drink to help with my daily workouts...this drink (grapefruit/my favorite)gives you a mental boost and also gives me the energy to have a awesome workout....This is by far the best energy drink out there..and drink them daily. In addition, the company donates the money to local charities..again so awesome!!"
Holly,B0078Y6OX8,Smells great and tastes even better...,I got my sister and mother hooked on this flavor. Is a deep flavor perfect for the Maryland winters and holidays.
Jessie Marafioti,B0009F3QL6,lonely evening drink,Yogi Egytian Licorice tea is a lovely way to relaze after dinner.  I have read in a health book that licorice tea help the blood to balance the sugar in the body after a meal.
Dr. Werner Schulz,B000E3FKXA,Best Cocoa Powder,"Actually, my wife is using this brand of cocoa powder, and she claims that after having tried many different brands this is the best brand on the market."
Marilyn Daggett,B003JA5KLM,Great coffee,The Keurig Green Mountain Nantucket Blend Coffee is great.  The flavor is pleasing and not too strong or too weak.  I like using the subscription plan.
DoodleBug,B000GINU8K,I adore this tea!,I am a tea junkie and this is one of my favorites for night-time; very mild and soothing.
Pillowtalk,B000FVBYCW,Great flavored tea,"This rosehip tea is surprisingly good, reminds me slightly of rhubarb with a subtle regular black tea undertone. The package did take 9 days to arrive & it was all crushed up inside the jiffy-bag so it's a good job it wasn't ordered as a gift. I also think the price is a bit steep for teabags. I just couldn't find this flavor in supermarkets, so I had to get it online."
Melter,B004AFXB3O,Dee-lish,"This caramel popcorn was absolutely delicious!!!  The 6 bags I ordered didn't last long in my house.  The price is a little steep, otherwise I would've ordered my second case already!  I'm waiting for a ""special occasion"" to order again, but definitely will!!!"
"NuiMax ""NuiMax""",B0009K77O8,BEST GENMAICHA TEA,IT'S THE BEST BROWN RICE GREEN TEA IF YOU LOVE GENMAICHA TEA THIS THE BRAND YOU WON'T DISAPPOINTED
miffie,B000PJMRWU,Not so good,These sugar free meringues are not very good.  They are very grainy.  I much prefer the ones with sugar but those were out of stock.
Judith H. Block,B001LQTD6Y,I love these cookies!,"It's so important to me that these cookies are sugar free and made with all natural ingredients. I love that they are made with spelt flour, too. They're delicious!!!"
Fred,B000HHLWMG,Dog Treats,Excellent service!  Excellent Price!  Excellent Product!  I can't keep the dog off the phone telling her friends how much she is enjoying her Best Buddy Treats!  I have a very happy dog!
CL,B002FJM9SU,Good food for baby and toddlers,I was pleased with this product for my baby. She has used organic formula along w/ breastfeeding. I was very confident feeding her this as I had done much research.
"S. Helwick ""organic mommy""",B000ER1EQI,Daughter's Fav Snank,"My daughter loves these snacks! They taste great and are heathier for her than other snack crackers. I just wish more came in the box for this price, since my daughter eats so many so fast!"
Bub,B0026RQTGE,Patches loves these!,Patches loves these and will put up with teeth brushing since he knows he'll get a Greenie at the end of it.
"Kim Cantrell ""Soap Box Bandit""",B001E96JZG,Quick Meal & Tastes Great!,"This package of six lasted no time in my home!  So simple to fix and great tasting, my teen boys had them eaten within a day!These simple meals would be great for brown bagging lunchers.  After only 4 minutes, you have a complete meal at restaurant quality."
Grad Mom,B00085F7SC,Perfect!,We purchased these for cake pop decorating and they worked out perfectly!  They were easy to work with and just the right color too!
Tulips,B001SAWZ8G,Delicious!!,"Tthe best lime curd I have ever had. Tangy, flavorful, and creamy. I found it about a dollar cheaper in the grocery store. Still pretty expensive. 5 bucks for a small jar. A great little indulgence."
James,B006ACQY8Y,Wonderful product,"I was very pleased with the Himalayan salt. It really does taste much better than ordinary salt and you can actually taste some of the other minerals in it. I would describe it like licking a salty rock, but in a good way. Very pleased and will be buying more."
ltxlady37,B0011MTYF8,Great tasting flavors.,"These are really good tasting flavors, my only complaint would be they aren't big enough and when you buy them in the  10 pack that they dont come with the lid that squirts the flavor out, instead it is just a covered lid which you have to remove to pour in the flavor thus you use more of the juice then needs to be used."
Hal C. Bryson,B002GOYT3M,A pleasant surprise,"As a single, middle-aged man who never really learned to cook, I'm always keeping my eye out for good frozen entrees.  This chicken curry, which I happened across in the local Ingles grocery store, was surprisingly tasty.  And I'm very picky.  Mind you, nowhere near as good as the Indian cuisine at two or three very good local restaurants, but for a frozen meal -- incredibly delicious.  The curry sauce is really quite good, the breast meat chicken is tender and the basmati rice was decent also."
GLC,B000QSON4K,Pill Pockets,The Greenies Pill Pockets are the first product that has effectively worked in getting my dogs to take their medications.  They actually look forward to this treat and make it a painless process rather than the difficult process it was in the past.
"W. Surrey ""average joe""",B002TMV3CG,Blah,"Didn't think this coffee was good or bad- just blah.  So, if it's on sale, grab it if you need cheap coffee for days when you don't demand good taste while getting your caffeine dose."
Mamac,B007R900WA,KEURIG CUP ORGANIZER,"It's not a problem with the product, but I didn't pay attention to the dimensions when I bought it and it seems really big for a small kitchen.  Will probably be returning it."
"T. Calvert ""T""",B000NLA51A,First had this 20 years ago and still remember it vividly!,"Yummy.  Texture is powdery so it mixes easily with water or milk.  More like matcha powder (green tea) or hot chocolate. Outstanding taste unlike any other unflavored coffee.  Brings back many memories of my time in the Peace Corps in 1991, sipping this coffee in Kingston or from the patio of a hostel on the highest peak in the Blue Mountains."
"greengiantdude ""greengiantdude""",B000CROPGG,Horrible - wouldn't feed it to a horse,"This cereal is hard, tasteless, and very difficult to chew.  Has a strange off-smell to it too.  I would not recommend this to anyone.  In fact I am going to write the company a letter since I am angry that I now have five and a half bags of crappy ""cereal"" lying around."
T. Lund,B001BM6IDY,The best around,We tried this product and were amazed. It tastes far better than any mix we've bought in a store. The only negative is that you tend to eat a lot more cake.
